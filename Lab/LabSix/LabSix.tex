\section*{Post-Lab}
\subsection*{First Order Low Pass Filter}
$Percentage Error = \frac{|measured-calculated|}{calculated} = \frac{|33.59-33.86|}{33.86} = 0.80\%$\\
\noindent The difference between our calculated and measured cutoff frequency is extremely small.

\subsection*{First Order High Pass Filter}
$Percentage Error = \frac{|measured-calculated|}{calculated} = \frac{|33.59-33.86|}{33.86} = 0.80\%$\\
\noindent The difference between our calculated and measured cutoff frequency is extremely small.

\subsection*{Second Order Low Pass Filter}
$Percentage Error = \frac{|measured-calculated|}{calculated} = \frac{|545.6-734|}{734} = 25.67\%$\\
\noindent The difference between our calculated and measured cutoff frequency is fairly high. This is most likely due to inaccurate use of the cursors in both LTSpice and the lab software.\\

\noindent The gain of the second order low pass filter decreases at a faster rate than the first order low pass filter, however, the second order low pass filter has a larger overshoot than the first order low pass filter. The first order low pass filter is better for uses where a low overshoot is needed, while the second order low pass filter is better for uses where a large rate of decrease is needed, and an overshoot is allowable.

\subsection*{Second Order High Pass Filter}
$Percentage Error = \frac{|measured-calculated|}{calculated} = \frac{|784.2-734|}{734} = 6.84\%$\\
\noindent The difference between our calculated and measured cutoff frequency is fairly low.\\

\noindent Both the theoretical and experimental Bode plots show similar slopes within the specified stop-band.\\

\noindent The gain of the second order high pass filter decreases at a faster rate than the first order high pass filter, however, the second order high pass filter has a larger overshoot than the first order high pass filter. The first order high pass filter is better for uses where a low overshoot is needed, while the second order high pass filter is better for uses where a large rate of decrease is needed, and an overshoot is allowable.\\

\noindent Increasing the resistance will result in a higher bandwidth, while decreasing the resistance will result in a lower bandwidth. It will have no effect on the frequency of maximum gain.

\subsection*{Second Order Bandpass Filter}
$Percentage Error = \frac{|measured-calculated|}{calculated} = \frac{|701.7-734|}{734} = 4.40\%$\\
$Percentage Error = \frac{|measured-calculated|}{calculated} = \frac{|1012.6-1600|}{1600} = 0.37\%$\\\
\noindent The difference between our calculated and measured maximum gain frequency is fairly low. Additionally, the difference between our calculated and measured bandwith is fairly low.

\subsection*{Second Order Band Reject Filter}
$Percentage Error = \frac{|measured-calculated|}{calculated} = \frac{|701.7-734|}{734} = 4.40\%$\\
$Percentage Error = \frac{|measured-calculated|}{calculated} = \frac{|1788.5-1591|}{1591} = 12.41\%$\\
\noindent The difference between our calculated and measured minimum gain frequency is fairly low. Additionally, the difference between our calculated and measured bandwith is fairly low.

\subsection*{Second Order Band Reject Filter with Different Resistor}
$f_{MinGain} = 734Hz$\\
$Bandwidth = 15900Hz$\\
$Percentage Error = \frac{|measured-calculated|}{calculated} = \frac{|701.7-734|}{734} = 4.40\%$\\
$Percentage Error = \frac{|measured-calculated|}{calculated} = \frac{|9965.4-15900|}{15900} = 37.32\%$\\
\noindent The difference between our calculated and measured minimum gain frequency is fairly low. Additionally, the difference between our calculated and measured bandwith is fairly high. This is most likely due to inaccurate use of the cursors in both LTSpice and the lab software.

\subsection*{Active Filters}
$f_c = 33.86 Hz$\\
$Percentage Error = \frac{|measured-calculated|}{calculated} = \frac{|33.59-33.86|}{33.86} = 0.80\%$\\
\noindent The difference between our calculated and measured cutoff frequency is extremely small.\\

\noindent The active filter has a similar rate of decrease in gain as the first order low pass filter, but has a lower rate of decrease in gain as the second order low pass filter. Additionally, it has a positive gain, while both the first and second order low pass filters begin at a gain very close to zero. The active circuit allows for positive gain, but dictates a second power supply. Additionally, it does not have any offshoot.\\

\subsection*{Active Filters with More Stages}
\noindent The two stage active filter has a similar rate of decrease in gain as the first order low pass filter, but has a lower rate of decrease in gain as the second order low pass filter. The gain begins at a negative number, and the cutoff of the filter is lower than the single stage active filter. The two stage filter has the same disadvantages as a single stage filter. However, it would excel in areas which require low frequencies and low overshoot.
